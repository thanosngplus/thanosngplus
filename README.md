# Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Thanos. I like programming because:
- I enjoy puzzles
- I get a "dopamine hit" when my code is running
- I get a "dopamine hit" when I improve my code
- I like it when a user tells me they love what I made 

I can work in both frontend and backend, but I'm more passionate about backend.
