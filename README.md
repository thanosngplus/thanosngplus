# Welcome 


### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Thanos, a Software Engineer! :smiley:

I'm passionate about solving technical and business problems with code. My greatest strength is also my greatest weakness: I can get really obsessed with what I'm currently working. As you can already tell, I'm not into work-life balance.

I enjoy diving into systems to learn how they tick by getting my hands dirty. I value knowledge of fundamentals, work ethic, and personality.

I want to become a member of a team that will allow me to collaborate, contribute and make a great impact to their products.
