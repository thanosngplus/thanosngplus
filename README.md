# Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Thanos. I like programming for its logical thinking and the dopamine hits that I get when I build something that works, is fast, and people can use it.
I'm passionate about backend development. I know enough JavaScript, TypeScript and Python to work productively.

I started learning Java because I got curious about the nature of the pure OOP paradigm. I became a fan.

My motto is "Keep curiosity burning!!!ðŸ”¥"
