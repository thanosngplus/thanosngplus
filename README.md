## About Me
My name is Thanos and I'm a software engineer. I'm both passionate and proud about my work.

I'm looking to collaborate with software engineers who care about their craft as much as I do, and treat it as something more than "just a job". 
I want to follow best practices because I care not only about the product but also about the maintainability and readability of the codebase, as well as the developer experience.
