# Welcome 


## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Thanos! :smiley:

I'm a software engineer walking on the never-ending road of self-improvement. My passion is backend development, and specifically distributed systems and data-intensive applications.

While I enjoy working with C# and .NET Core, I keep myself language agnostic, open-minded and updated with the latest advancements in software engineering.
