## About Me

I'm a software engineer who loves solving technical and business problems with code.

My motto is: **Learn like a scientist, build like an engineer.**

I enjoy diving into systems, getting my hands dirty tinkering,  learn how they tick, and making them harder, better, faster, and stronger.

While I believe that languages are tools, I enjoy working with strongly typed languages like Java, TypeScript, Golang, and Rust! 
However, I value fundamental understanding, work ethic, and the ability to learn new things and adapt more.

I'm currently looking to work for a product-based company as part of a tight-knit team where I can make a big positive impact.
