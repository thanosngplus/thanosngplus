## About Me
As a software engineer I'm driven by curiosity and the dopamine rush that I get when I improve my code or overcome a technical challenge. 
I'm passionate about designing and building reliable, scalable and performant software that makes a positive impact on people's lives.

I enjoy collaborating with like-minded professionals and, through teamwork and constructive exchanges, develop high-quality software and ourselves as individuals.
