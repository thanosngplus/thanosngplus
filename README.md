# Welcome 


### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Thanos, a Software Engineer! :smiley:

I'm passionate about solving technical and business problems with code. I enjoy diving into a project, and learn how it works by getting my hands dirty. When it comes to teammates, I value work ethic and personality just as much as competence.
I want to become a member of a team that will allow me to collaborate, contribute and create positive value for their software.
