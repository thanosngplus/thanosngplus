## About Me

I'm a software engineer who loves solving technical and business problems with code.

My motto is: **Learn like a scientist, build like an engineer.**

I enjoy diving into systems, getting my hands dirty tinkering,  learn how they tick, and making them harder, better, faster, and stronger.

While I believe that languages are tools, I enjoy working with strongly typed languages like Golang, TypeScript, and Rust! 
I'm also confident on my ability to pick new technologies, and ultimately learn them deeply.

I'm currently looking to work for a product-based company as part of a tight-knit team where I can make a big positive impact.
