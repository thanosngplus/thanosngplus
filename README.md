## About Me
My name is Thanos and I'm a software engineer. I'm both passionate and proud about my work.

I'm never gonna claim that I know everything or that I'm always right, but I do claim that I can eventually do anything my mind sets into.

In my personal projects I follow the guidelines of [the cult of done](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJQj1uKtnus) and I mark everything I consider "DONE" as archived.
