## About Me
My name is Thanos and I'm a software engineer. I used to be a full-stack developer, but after reading DDIA I became more interested in backend, 
and want to work on data-intensive applications, distributed systems, and microservices.

As someone who takes pride in what he does I enjoy writing performant, scalable and maintainable applications. 
I'm looking for a company and coworkers who care about their craft, and treat it as more than "just a job". 
I want to follow best practices because I care not only about the product but also about the maintainability and readability of the codebase, as well as the developer experience.
