## About Me

I'm a software engineer who loves solving technical and business problems with code.

My motto is: **Learn like a scientist, build like an engineer.**

I enjoy diving into systems, getting my hands dirty tinkering, learn how they tick, and making them harder, better, faster, and stronger.

While I believe that languages are tools, I enjoy working with strongly typed languages like TypeScript, C# and Golang! I'm also confident on my ability to pick new technologies, and ultimately learn them deeply.

I'm currently looking to work for a product-based company to be a part of a tight-knit team, in a position where I can make a big positive impact.
