## About Me
My name is Thanos and I'm a software engineer. I used to be a full-stack developer, but after reading DDIA I became more interested in backend, 
and want to work on data-intensive applications, distributed systems, and microservices.

As someone who takes pride in what he does I enjoy writing performant, scalable and maintainable applications. 
However, I won't let pride get in the way of my self-improvement or the results because, at the end of day, there's no value to software no one wants to use. 

For my next job I want to use Java and Spring as backend developer.
