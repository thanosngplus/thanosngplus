# Welcome ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer who's passionate about solving technical and business problems with code. My greatest strength is also my greatest weakness: I can get really obsessed with what I'm currently working. 
As you can already tell, I'm not a fan of the 40-hour work week or into work-life balance.

I enjoy diving into systems to learn how they tick by getting my hands dirty. I value knowledge of fundamentals, work ethic, and speed of skill acquisition.
