## About Me
I've been in love with programming since I attended Harvard's CS50. "Learn like a scientist, apply like an engineer" is my motto. 
I enjoy diving into systems, get my hands dirty and learn how they tick in order to improve them.

I'm currently looking for a backend development role. I believe that languages are tools (I do have a soft spot for strongly typed languages like C#, Java and Go), 
but what's more important are fundamentals and adaptation.

I'd love to work for a product-based company, as part of a tight knit team where I can make a positive impact!
